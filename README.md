## PHP Symfony 4 - Todo list app

This is a simple example of a todo-list app written in PHP (Symfony 4.x).

Please remember that is a full backend app with some API routes for CRUD operations, so you won't see any form or something like that. 


#### Install Instructions

0 - Clone this app

1 - `cd docker`

2 - `docker-compose up -d`

3 - And done! (http://localhost:8177/)

Also if you need to connect on the MYSQL docker instance, use

`mysql -h 0.0.0.0 -u root -P 13306 -p`

You can see the password on the `docker-compose.yml` file as well.
